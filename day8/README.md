# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

## Clearning Template Files
```
rm .\contracts\*
rm .\scripts\*
rm .\tests\*
yarn hardhat clean
```

## Running your tests
```
 yarn hardhat compile 
 yarn hardhat test 
 ```
